We are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

We may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 
Example 1:
Input: list1 = [2, 4, 3] and list2 = [5, 6, 4]
Output: [7, 0, 8]
Explanation: Since the digits are stored in reverse order, reverse the numbers first
             to get the original number and then add them as → 342 + 465 = 807.


Example 2:
Input: list1 = [0] and list2 = [0]
Output: [0]


Example 3:
Input: list1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9] and list2 = [9, 9, 9, 9]
Output: [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Explanation: Since the digits are stored in reverse order, reverse the numbers first to get the original
             number and then add them as → 9999999 + 9999 = 8999001. Refer to the image below.
