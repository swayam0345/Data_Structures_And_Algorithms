Given an array of numbers, we need to return the count of reverse pairs.
Reverse Pairs are those pairs where (i < j) and (arr[i] > (2 * arr[j])).


Example 1:
Input: N = 5, array[] = {1, 3, 2, 3, 1}
Output: 2
Explanation: The pairs are (3, 1) and (3, 1) as from both the pairs the condition arr[i] > 2*arr[j] is satisfied.

Example 2:
Input: N = 4, array[] = {3, 2, 1, 4}
Output: 1

Explaination: There is only 1 pair (3, 1) that satisfy the condition arr[i] > 2*arr[j].
