Given the heads of two singly linked-lists ‘headA’ and ‘headB’, return the node at which the two lists intersect.
If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

Note: that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.


Example 1:
Input: List 1 = [1, 3, 1, 2, 4], List 2 = [3, 2, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: Here, both lists intersecting nodes start from node 2.


Example 2:
Input: List1 = [1, 2, 7], List 2 = [2, 8, 1]
Output: Null
Explanation: Here, both lists do not intersect and thus no intersection node is present.


Example 3:
Input: list1 = [4, 1, 8, 4, 5], list2 = [5, 6, 1, 8, 4, 5]
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: Here, both lists intersecting nodes start from node 8.
             list1  4 -> 1 __________
                                    ↓
                                    8 -> 4 -> 5
             list2  5 -> 6 -> 1 ____↑
