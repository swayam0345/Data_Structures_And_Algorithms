Given the head of a singly linked list of `n` nodes and an integer `k`, where k is less than or equal to `n`.

Your task is to reverse the order of each group of `k` consecutive nodes, if `n` is not divisible by `k`,
then the last group of remaining nodes should remain unchanged.


Example 1:
Input Format:
    Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10
    K = 3
Output: 3  2  1  6  5  4  9  8  7  10
Explanation:
_____________________________________________    _____________________________________________    _____________________________________________
|    _________    _________    _________    |    |    _________    _________    _________    |    |    _________    _________    _________    |    __________
|    |_1_|_n_| -> |_2_|_n_| -> |_3_|_n_|  --|--> |    |_4_|_n_| -> |_5_|_n_| -> |_6_|_n_|  --|--> |    |_9_|_n_| -> |_8_|_n_| -> |_9_|_n_|  --|--> |_10_|_n_|
|___________________________________________|    |___________________________________________|    |___________________________________________|     Remaining nodes
            Group to be reversed                            Group to be reversed                                Group to be reversed                unchanged

    Group 1 - Reverse nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 to become 3 -> 2 -> 1.
    Group 2 - Reverse nodes 4 -> 5 -> 6 to become 6 -> 5 -> 4.
    Group 3 - Reverse nodes 7 -> 8 -> 9 to become 9 -> 8 -> 7.
    Node 10 remains as is since there are no more groups of size K remaining.

Example 2:
Input Format:
    LinkedList: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 7 -> 9 -> 2
    K = 4
Output: 7 3 4 5 9 2
Explanation:
    Group 1 - Reversed nodes 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 7 to become 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.
    Group 2 - Nodes 9 -> 2 remain unchanged as they are not a complete group of size K.
