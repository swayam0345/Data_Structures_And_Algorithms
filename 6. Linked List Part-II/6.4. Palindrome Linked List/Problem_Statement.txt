Check if the given Linked List is a Palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, verse, or sentence (such as "Able was I ere I saw Elba")
or a number (such as 1881) that reads the same backward or forward.


Example 1:
Input Format:
    LL: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
Output: True
Explanation: A linked list with values "1 2 3 2 1" is a palindrome because its elements read the same
            from left to right and from right to left, making it symmetrical and mirroring itself.


Example 2:
Input Format:
    LL: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
Output: True
Explanation: A linked list with values "1 2 3 3 2 1" is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.


Example 3:
Input Format:
    LL: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3
Output: False
Explanation: The linked list "1 2 3 2 3" is not a palindrome because it reads differently in reverse order,
            where "3 2 3 2 1" is not the same as the original sequence "1 2 3 2 3."
